## Overview

This project is a lightweight vanilla JavaScript application built with Vite. It uses the MediaDevices API to access the user’s camera, displays a live video preview, and allows the user to capture a still image to a canvas.

The focus of the project is clarity, correct use of browser APIs, and clean separation between camera logic and UI behavior.

## Features

-  Live camera preview using the MediaDevices API
-  Capture a still image to a canvas
-  Toggle between live preview and captured photo (retake functionality)
-  No frameworks, pure modern JavaScript
